## 🛒 4. Order Creation & Management

**Purpose:** Allow users to place orders directly through canteen or restaurant integrations.

### New Order Flow

#### For School Canteens
1. User selects canteen (e.g., **LG1**, **LG7**, or **LSK**).
2. The app embeds the **canteen ordering webpage** within DeliverU.
3. After selecting items and pressing “Order,” user is redirected back to DeliverU.
4. DeliverU fetches the item list and pricing data from the canteen's webpage.
5. User confirms and pays within app.
6. The order enters a **pending state**, awaiting deliverer acceptance.

#### For External Restaurants (e.g., McDonald's, Subway)
- DeliverU backend hosts an **Android emulator** to listen for menu updates from official apps.
- Menu updates are synced automatically with DeliverU for order placement.

---

### Order Management Rules
- Pending orders stay open until accepted by a deliverer.
- If **no deliverer accepts within 30 minutes**, the user may **cancel the order**, triggering a **full refund**.
- **When a deliverer accepts:**
  - Deliverer **pays upfront** at pickup.
  - Upon successful delivery, the system reimburses the **food cost + tip** from escrow.

---

## 🚴 5. Deliverer Queue & Workflow

**Purpose:** Provide a personalized and efficient way for deliverers to find the best orders.

### Features
- View available orders filtered by:
  - Hall location  
  - Order amount  
  - Preferred range and timings  
- Accept orders directly from the queue.
- Once accepted:
  - Order removed from the public queue.
  - Orderer automatically notified.
  - Deliverer receives order details and any auto-message (e.g., “Deliver to lobby.”).

### Proof of Delivery Flow

| Step | Required Action |
|------|-----------------|
| Pickup | Upload photo of the purchased meal |
| Delivery | Upload photo proof of drop-off |
| Confirmation | Both parties confirm delivery status |
| Payment | Automatically released after confirmation |

---

## 💳 6. Payment and Escrow System

**Purpose:** Ensure transparent, safe, and fair transactions between Orderers and Deliverers — while minimizing costs and legal complexity.

---

### Option A — Traditional Payment + Escrow (Default Mode)

**Purpose:** Provide a standard money-based payment structure for users who prefer direct financial transactions.

#### Payment Flow
1. **Orderer pays** when creating the order.  
   (Payment is held in **escrow**.)
2. When a **Deliverer accepts**, they **pay upfront** for the order at pickup point.
3. Upon successful delivery and confirmation:
   - **Escrow releases** the full order price + **tip** to Deliverer.
4. If no deliverer accepts within 30 minutes → **auto refund** to Orderer.

#### Tip Formula
\[
\text{Tip} = (\text{Order Price} \times 10\%) + C \times \text{Distance}
\]
> where \( C \) is a constant determined by distance multiplier.  
Values are rounded to avoid decimals.

#### Platform Fee
A small **platform fee** (around $0.5–$1.0) is deducted per order to cover operational costs (e.g., payment SDK charges and server fees).

---

### Option B — Campus Credit System (Alternative Mode)

**Purpose:** Eliminate payment gateway dependency and reduce legal and financial risk by using a **non-monetary exchange system**.

#### Concept Overview
- Introduce an **internal credit currency**, named **DeliverU Credits** (DC).
- **1 delivery = +1 DC**
- **1 order = −1 DC**

This means students **earn credits** by delivering others’ orders and **spend credits** when using the app to have food delivered to them.

#### Credit Rules
| Action | Credit Change | Description |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Deliver successfully | +1 DC | Earn one credit for completing a delivery |
| Place an order | −1 DC | Spend one credit to have a delivery fulfilled |
| Cancel order (before acceptance) | 0 | No credit consumed |
| Order canceled (after acceptance) | Refunds DC to orderer (upon confirmation) |

#### Advantages
- 💸 **No payment processor fees** (no Alipay / WeChat cost)  
- ⚖️ **No real money handled by platform**, minimizing **legal liability**  
- 🔁 **Self-sustaining ecosystem** — encourages active participation  
- 📉 **Reduced barrier to entry** for students (no bank setup needed)

#### Additional Features
- Optional **credit trading** or **bonus credits** for frequent users.  
- Admins can **manually distribute credits** during system startup or promotions.  
- In future, credits can be **tokenized or integrated** into scholarship/reward systems if required.

---

## 💬 7. Temporary Chat Session

**Purpose:** Provide a secure, ephemeral communication channel between the Orderer and Deliverer for coordination.

### Chat Flow
1. When a deliverer accepts an order, a **temporary chat session** is automatically created.
2. The system sends **auto messages** first:
   - Orderer’s delivery preference (e.g., *“Meet in LG7 lobby”*)  
   - Deliverer’s ETA or pickup info
3. After auto messages, both users can freely chat to coordinate any changes or clarifications.

### Key Features
- **End-to-end secured via HTTPS**
- **Session expires** after order completion or cancellation
- **No chat history stored** — messages are deleted once the session closes
- Supports **text and system message types** (no media upload in this version)

### Benefits
- Enhances communication while maintaining privacy  
- Prevents data accumulation and ensures full compliance with privacy policies  
- Auto-injects relevant preference data for smoother coordination

---

## ⭐ 8. Rating & Review System

**Purpose:** Maintain trust and fairness within the DeliverU ecosystem.

### Rating Flow
- Both Orderer and Deliverer rate each other upon delivery completion.
- Ratings include:
  - ⭐ 1–5 stars  
  - Optional written feedback  
- Ratings contribute to a visible **Reputation Score** in each profile.

## 💰 Server Cost Evaluation

**Goal:** Establish a stable backend infrastructure with minimal cost by leveraging HKUST resources and flexible hosting options.

### Strategy & Priority
1. **University Collaboration (Preferred Option)**  
   - Submit a proposal to **HKUST IT or Entrepreneurship Center** for **approval and support**.  
   - Request permission to access and integrate with the **school email system** (for secure login).  
   - Apply to rent a **small node** on the university’s internal network for backend hosting.  
     > This is likely to be low-cost or free if approved.

2. **Backup Plan: Personal Server on Campus**
   - If approval is not granted, negotiate to **host our own physical server** on campus (e.g., lab or office corner).  
   - Purchase or assemble a low-power **dedicated PC** for backend hosting.

3. **Dorm-based Hosting (Last Resort)**
   - If university hosting is unavailable, host the backend temporarily inside a **dorm room** using a personal PC or mini server.  
   - This approach minimizes cost significantly while maintaining acceptable latency within the HKUST network.

### Expected Benefits
- **Low operational cost** (no commercial cloud instance needed initially)  
- **High performance** due to local campus network proximity  
- **Full control** over server configuration and data access policies  
- **Scalable path** — can migrate to official infrastructure if app gains traction
